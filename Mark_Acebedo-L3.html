<h2>Assignment 3</h2>
   <p>Create a basic webpage that includes the image “one.gif.” Use an interval timer to change image source to “two.gif” every 5 seconds. If the image is clicked, change the image source to “three.gif.” Provide a page element that when clicked, stops the timer. Be sure you know how to test that the timer has been stopped.   </p>
<div style="text-align:center">
  <p><img src="one.gif" id="imgNumber1" onClick="changenumber();" /></p> <!-- This calls the function changenumber which will change the number to "3" when clicked on -->
    <button onclick="stopTimer()">Stop timer</button> <!-- This stops the 5 second time interval function "stopTimer" -->
</div>
