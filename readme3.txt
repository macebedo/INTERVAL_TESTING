This is not a tutorial. There are my codes created for the request below:

Create a basic webpage that includes the image “one.gif.”

Use an interval timer to change image source to “two.gif” every 5 seconds.

If the image is clicked, change the image source to “three.gif.”

Provide a page element that when clicked, stops the timer.

Be sure you know how to test that the timer has been stopped.
